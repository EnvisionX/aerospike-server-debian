Description: Distributed datastore with elastic server properties.
 Aerospike is a distributed, scalable NoSQL database. It is architected
 with three key objectives:
 * To create a high-performance, scalable platform that would meet the needs
  of todayâ€™s web-scale applications;
 * To provide the robustness and reliability (i.e., ACID) expected from
  traditional databases;
 * To provide operational efficiency (minimal manual involvement).
